President Joe Biden is proving a point he had previously argued against. He is releasing record amounts of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to bring down the price of gas. He is trying to ease the pain at the pump which happens with a simple solution: increasing supply.
Rather than depleting this strategic supply, we have a better solution in North Dakota. Produce more. Here. Every day.
Biden's policies disincentivize domestic drilling. This drives prices up. Which causes political pain. Which causes the President to increase supply. If he elected to let the market work and allow producers to do what they do best, he wouldn't need to intervene.
More supply, lower price. It's a beautiful thing.
If only Biden was paying attention to just how simple this is. During the Trump era, domestic production was up. The additional supply then brought prices down. We have seen this movie before. It's not complicated. The high prices at least awaken Biden to the angry consumer. The solution is simple: Drill baby drill.
Ironically Biden is making our point for us. The more he unleashes domestic oil production, the lower the price goes.
What's not to love? The dirty little secret is, this administration hates domestic oil production. They will tolerate it for some temporary relief at the pump, but not for long. The inconvenient fact is that more supply equals a lower price.
The green agenda is a costly endeavor. That reality is landing at Biden's feet with a thud, so he whipsaws back to wanting more supply, but depleting our U.S. strategic supply is not the right approach. It's right here. Turn North Dakota's Bakken fields free. We are the nation's strategic reserve.
