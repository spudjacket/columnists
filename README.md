Opinion  The Washington Post guide to writing an op-ed

(Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)
Each month, The Washington Post publishes dozens of op-eds from guest authors. These articles — written by subject-matter experts, politicians, journalists and other people with something interesting to say — provide a diversity of voices and perspectives for our readers.
The information and tips below are meant to demystify our selection and editing process, and to help you sharpen your argument before submitting an op-ed of your own.

An op-ed is an opinion piece by a guest writer that makes a clear argument about a topic usually (but not always) in the news. The name is derived from the traditional placement of these pieces opposite the editorial page of the printed newspaper.

Op-eds should be focused: 750 to 800 words is ideal. Op-eds can incorporate charts, photos, audio or even comics.

Your thesis — your main argument — is the most important part of an op-ed, so make sure it is easy to locate and understand. Ask yourself: What is the two- or three-sentence takeaway from this piece? Or what might the headline on this piece be? If it’s not clear, it’s not an op-ed — not yet. (Tip: Try writing your column as a tweet or a short email. Then incorporate that near the top of your piece.)

What is not an op-ed?
Personal essays that don’t make an argument are generally not op-eds. Even if the op-ed includes a personal story, it should have a point to make — something readers can engage with and think about.

Journalistic investigations without an argument are not op-eds. Poems and works of fiction usually aren’t op-eds either. Neither are reviews of books, movies, television shows or other media. We only rarely accept op-eds that are written as open letters.

Op-eds also aren’t meant to be a tool for public relations. For example, we won’t accept submissions from people praising the company where they work. An op-ed should serve readers, not the interests of the author.

Who can submit an op-ed?
Anyone can submit an op-ed to The Washington Post. Yes, really! We review them all.

You do not need to live in Washington, D.C., or in the United States, to write an op-ed for The Post. You do not have to be famous or have been published previously. You do not have to have a lot of Twitter followers. You do not need to work as a journalist or in politics.

For example, The Washington Post has recently published op-eds from:
High school students
Incarcerated people
Tribal leaders
Community activists
Climate scientists
Technology experts
Refugees
Parents trying to do their best
How do I get my op-ed published?
Return to menu
The easiest way to get your op-ed in front of our editors is to submit it using the form on this page. Please submit a full draft — not a pitch or an idea. And please paste the full text of your submission, rather than linking or attaching it.

We do our best to read all submissions promptly, and will usually contact you within one week if we are interested in publishing your article. If you do not hear from us in a week, it is safe to assume we will not be able to use your article. It is okay to follow up with an email to oped@washpost.com if you want to clarify the status of your submission.

Can I send something I’ve already published?
No. We only publish op-eds that are exclusive to The Post. That means we can’t use anything that has been published on another news outlet or website, trade publication, personal blog or the like. That also means your piece should be exclusive — in other words, don’t send it to another news organization while it is under consideration by The Post.

How do you choose which op-eds to publish?
When considering op-eds, we look for pieces that will accomplish one or more of the following goals for our readers:


Help people more deeply understand a topic in the news.
Help them understand what it means for them.
Equip them with arguments they can employ when talking about the subject.
Elevate ideas that help them think about the world differently.
Expose them to topics they might not have heard about.
Help them better articulate their own perspective.
Help them understand perspectives different from their own.
We also often publish op-eds that break news, meaning it reveals something of consequence that was not previously known to the public.

Who are these readers?
A lot of people read the Washington Post Opinions section, and each has a different life experience and expertise. So you should write for a broad audience and assume that the average reader does not have your level of knowledge on your topic.

Do you only publish op-eds you agree with?
No! We strive to publish a diversity of opinions on our op-ed page. Often, that means we are specifically seeking viewpoints that are different from those of our columnists or the Editorial Board. (That’s a group of journalists whose articles represent the views of The Washington Post as an institution.) Also, no two editors on our diverse team will agree or disagree with the exact same set of ideas.

Do you pay op-ed writers?
Yes, we offer a fee to working writers and many other contributors whose op-eds we publish. Exceptions include politicians, government officials and others writing in their official capacities.

Can I write under a pseudonym?
No. Unless under extreme circumstances — such as when publishing an op-ed would pose a threat to your life — we must publish your full name in the byline.

Can I write in my own voice?
Yes, please! Write how you sound, not how you think The Washington Post should sound. After you’ve written your op-ed, try reading back through and circling any words you wouldn’t use in conversation. Then replace them with different words. Or try reading the piece aloud; if you trip over a phrase or a sentence, revise.

Do I need to write about the news?
In most cases the op-eds we publish will have a news hook. That means they are pegged to a news or cultural topic that is likely to be of interest to readers now.

Timing is to an op-ed as location is to real estate, especially if you are writing on a breaking news topic. That means an op-ed submitted on the day after an event will have an advantage over one submitted a week later, when the conversation has slowed.

Not every op-ed will be about the news of the day, but it should always have an original angle — something readers might not have thought of before and will find interesting.

How should I structure my op-ed?
The format of your op-ed helps the reader understand your argument. Here is a classic structure that does this effectively:
- Statement of thesis or problem
- Three reasons this argument is right or wrong
- Conclusion
There are many other ways of presenting ideas that work, but any successful op-ed needs structure and a logical flow that makes the reader’s life easier, not harder.

What is a lede (also known as a lead)?
Return to menu
A lede is the opening sentence or sentences of your op-ed, and it’s very important.

A good lede will draw in readers and persuade them to keep reading. It can be your thesis, but it doesn’t have to be. In any event, make sure to get to the crux of your argument fast — that means in the first couple of paragraphs. Remember, you have only 750 words, so make each of them count.

What is a kicker?
A kicker is the last sentence of your article. It should leave readers satisfied that they knew what the piece was about and that it was worth getting through. Sometimes circling back to the beginning does the trick.

One thing you shouldn’t do is introduce a new thought you don’t develop that leaves the reader thinking: Why didn’t they write that column? Another bad idea: ending with a quote that tells readers what someone else was thinking — but not what you think.

If you think it’s not good enough, you’re not done. Take a walk. Think of the pithiest (or, if appropriate, cheekiest) thing you can say about the piece. Then make that the kicker.

Have any other tips?
Make sure the facts are right, and be prepared to back them up. Accuracy is as important to opinion pieces as it is to news reporting, and even minor errors will undermine confidence in the broader point you want to make. Don’t work from memory — if you make a statement of fact in the text, you should be able to supply your source. Our editors will ask you for it.
The more complex the thought, the shorter the sentence. It’s good to mix up sentence length, but especially when you’re making a sophisticated or complicated point, don’t overtax readers’ powers of concentration. Many sentences benefit from the simple act of splitting them in two.
Must this be in question form? Or is the question a lazy device for making an insinuation without really owning it, or failing to completely think through what you’re trying to say? There are no doubt times when raising questions is an effective technique; sometimes, it’s just easier to plunk that question mark at the end. Before you do, ask yourself.
Numbers are powerful, in limited number. They should be in the column to drive home the point to readers, not to drive them away or make their eyes glaze over. Make readers’ numeric lives easier by not comparing apples and oranges, or maybe even different kinds of apples. E.g., don’t combine percentages with raw numbers. It’s asking readers to do a calculation that slows them down, distracts them and risks losing them. Be careful about not overloading the reader with too many numbers. If you have one sentence using numbers to underscore/prove your point, do you need the second one to make that same point?
Be clear about your reasoning and thinking. Remember, you’ve already thought your argument through; readers haven’t. The point and linkages you are making may seem obvious to you, but you are probably a few steps ahead of the reader. Slow down and let them catch up.
Speaking of which, no jargon. It hurts readers’ heads, and that makes them stop reading. Instead of the word “remuneration” for example, just say “payment.”
Try not to zigzag too much by anticipating multiple reasons the fundamental argument is not correct before getting to the fundamental argument. It’s good to acknowledge counterarguments, but serial second-guessing of the basic point is distracting.
